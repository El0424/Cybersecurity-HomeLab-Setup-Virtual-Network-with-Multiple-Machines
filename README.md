## Overview

This project focuses on creating a Cybersecurity Home Lab utilizing VirtualBox to establish a virtual network configured as a NAT Network. The lab consists of multiple virtual machines, including Kali Linux for penetration testing, Ubuntu/CentOS for server configurations, and Windows for testing Windows-specific vulnerabilities. The NAT Network allows seamless internet access for the VMs while keeping them isolated from the host network, enhancing security and preventing unintended exposure. Within this environment, key security tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark are installed to facilitate hands-on learning experiences. The lab also can incorporates automation tools like Ansible and monitoring solutions like Zabbix to streamline operations and track network activities. 

  This setup provides an ideal platform for experimenting with real-world scenarios, including vulnerability assessments, threat detection, and incident response.



## Features

- **Multi-Machine Setup:** Deploy multiple virtual machines with different operating systems for comprehensive testing and learning.
- **Network Segmentation:** Utilize VLANs and firewalls to create isolated environments for secure testing of vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Vulnerable Applications:** Implement intentionally vulnerable applications for hands-on practice in exploitation and remediation techniques.
- **Realistic Scenarios:** Create and simulate real-world cyber threats and incidents to develop incident response skills and improve security posture.


## Tools and Technologies

This project leverages the following tools and technologies:

- **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows Server 2022
- **Penetration Testing Tools:** Nmap

- **Firewall:** pfSense configured between the attacker and target network
- **IDS/IPS:** Snort/Suricata monitoring traffic between segments

### Installation and Set-up

**Step 1: Install Virtualization Software**
   
1. **Install VirtualBox**

Open the link [Download Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and download your OS installer (VirtualBox for MacOS/WindowsOS/Linux)

2. **Install VirtualBox:**

- **Windows:** Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions.
- **macOS:** Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file, then move the VirtualBox icon to your Applications folder.
- **Linux:** Use your system's package manager to install VirtualBox. For example, on Ubuntu, you would run:


  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install virtualbox

3. **Install VirtualBox Extension Pack:**
    - **Download the Extension Pack:** Go to the [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and find the Extension Pack.
   - **Open VirtualBox:** Launch the VirtualBox software.
   - **Access Preferences:** Go to `File > Preferences > Extensions`.
   - **Add New Package:** Click the **Add New Package** button, select the downloaded Extension Pack, and install it.

**Step 2: Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**

1. **Download OS Images:**
   - **Ubuntu:** Download the Ubuntu desktop image from [Download Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
   - **Kali Linux:** Download Kali Linux from [Download Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
   - **Windows(optional): Download Windows Evaluation Versions from [Download Windows Evaluation Versions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter)



## Results

This project successfully demonstrates:

- The ability to exploit various vulnerabilities and simulate attacks in a secure, isolated environment.
- Deployment of defense mechanisms that effectively detect, block, and log malicious activities.
- Automated scripts that enhance both offensive and defensive cybersecurity capabilities.

The results include detailed reports on vulnerabilities found and how they were mitigated, as well as lessons learned from improving network security.
